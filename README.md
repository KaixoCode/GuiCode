# GuiCode

This repo contains Gui code that I am developing for another project of mine. It uses OpenGL and as of now only supports Windows. 
The code is probably far from perfect, it's very much WIP, and my first attempt at creating a general Gui library. 
If you have any feedback you can find me on Discord @Kaixo#0001
