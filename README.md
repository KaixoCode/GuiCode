# GuiCode

This repo contains Gui code that I am developing for fun. It uses OpenGL and as of now only supports Windows. 
The code is probably far from perfect, it's very much WIP, and my first attempt at creating a general Gui library. 
If you have any feedback you can find me on Discord @Kaixo#0001
